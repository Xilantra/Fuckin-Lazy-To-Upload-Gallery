  <strong>Nope.</strong><br>
  It will display any image on your folder; without codes, with style.<br>

  <strong>The Story</strong><br>
  I had a problem with my client, they want to upload all their picture in their static gallery page. I tried to have something plain like maybe using Flickr API or Dropbox gallery or anything simple because I'm too lazy to upload all their picture and using a CMS gallery or anything that include a login system will only cause them (me) a headache.<br>
<br>
I'm too lazy for that.<br>
<br>
So I google some JS/PHP gallery and none of them suit my needs. I want something like <a href="http://pinterest.com/afiq" title="Follow me!">Pinterest</a> because it's simple and just perfect for a gallery with a lot of pictures.<br>
And this is it, the result.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, enough shit.

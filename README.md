  <strong>Nope.</strong><br>
  It's a simple solution to display any image on your folder;<br>
  without codes, with style. Simple.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>For what?</strong><br>
  Portfolio, gallery, collections, and anything related to images.<br>
<br>
  <strong>The Story</strong><br>
  I had a problem with my client, they want to upload all their picture in their static gallery page. I tried to have something plain like maybe using Flickr API or Dropbox gallery or anything simple because I'm too lazy to upload all their picture and using a CMS gallery or anything that include a login system will only cause them (me) a headache.<br>
<br>
<strong>I'm too lazy for that.</strong><br>
<br>
So I googled for some JS/PHP gallery but none of them suit my needs. I want something like <a href="http://pinterest.com/afiq" title="Follow me!">Pinterest</a>, or masonry style, or something with mosaic layout because it's simple and just perfect for a gallery with a lot of pictures.<br>
And this is it, the <a href="http://afiq.me/kebun/Fuckin-Lazy-To-Upload-Gallery" title="Share it!">result</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, enough shit.
